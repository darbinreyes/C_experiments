Question 4.

Explain how to use XOR for error correction.
XOR outputs 1 only when bits differ , 0 otherwise.


Error correction schemes are called error correction codes (ECC). One such
scheme is called single-bit error correction (SEC) ECC. This scheme maps a data
word to a longer sequence of bits called the ECC codeword. These bits are called
check bits. The check bits are generated by performing an XOR recursively on the
data word bits. To detect an error in the stored code word, the check bits are
recomputed and then XOR'ed with the stored check bits. If the value of the
resulting XOR operation is called the ECC syndrome. In this scheme, if the ECC
syndrome value is non-zero, an error has occurred (is detected). The non-zero
value indicates the bit position of the error. The error can be corrected by
flipping the corresponding bits value.
